How to add authentication

Step 1:
Create columns in user table and migrate it.

Step 2:
Crate a folder for app layout and add header, footer, sidebar, etc and master files
Then include all files in master file and extend master files view and yield the views in Masterfile

Note: for header and footer you can use default code for layout folder which is provided by Laravel

Step 3:
Add routes to access this views in routes page with  middleware

Note: you can use already created routes by Laravel for reference where middleware is already use so it will give you the idea about the middleware

=====================================

If yo want to create the multiple type of user 

then create the separate layout folder for that user 

create the middleware that will access only those pages for that specific user

and add the condition in login controller to send user to different pages for different usertype

create the routes and assign middleware to them so they can only access those specific pages for that user
