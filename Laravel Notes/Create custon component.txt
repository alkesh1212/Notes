Components are used to create and reuse the HTML component

Step 1: 
Create a component through command line.
Command :

php artisan make:component componentname

It will create a two files 
one in app folder also known as main file
and second in view folder 
In the Main component file in app folder we pass the values for variable to make component dynamic 
and in second file we create a component to uses  in views it has .balde extension

Step 2:
now create a component in second file (.blade)
<div>

<label> {{$label}}</label>
<input type="{{$type}}" name="{{$name}}" placeholder="{{$placeholder}}" >
</div>


Step 3:

pass those values into first main file
so we can assign values to it dynamically

    public $name;
    public $label;
    public $placeholder;
    public $type;
    public function __construct( $type, $name, $label, $placeholder)
    {
        $this->type = $type;
        $this->label = $label;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->placeholder = $placeholder;
    }


Step 4:
use the component in view page


<x-abc_component type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter email" label="Name:" />
