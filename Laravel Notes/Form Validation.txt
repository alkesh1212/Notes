 For form validation, we have to write the following syntax in the controller

       $request->validate([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'required | email',
        'number' => 'required |digits:10'
       ]);

Here $request is the name of the variable that is sending all data of the post method of form into the controller through Route

validate() is a predefined function for validation
inside the validation, we use [] because we have to validate multiple fields.

'name','email','number' is the names of the input field

 'required |digits:10' are the  validation rules

AND IN VIEW

<div>
label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" name="name" value ="{{old('name')}}"><br>
      <span>
          @error('name')
          {{$message}}
          @enderror
      </span>
</div>

@error('name of input field') is a predefined function to execute the code if an error occurs after validation

{{$message}} will print the error message

value ="{{old('name')}}" is used to maintain the old value of the field  if an error occurs in another field
