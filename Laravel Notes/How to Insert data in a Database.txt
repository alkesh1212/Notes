How to Insert Data in a Database

Previously we have seen how to send data to the controller from FORM(view)

to store data in a database :


Step 1:

create a model and database and connect the model to the database


step 2:

include the model in the controller page

use App\Models\moduleName;


step 3:

create the object of model

$data= new modelName;


step 4:

now using the object set the data received from post method into the database


$data->columnName = $request['input field name'];
$data->save();


Example:

file name: DemoController.php

use App\Models\contact;

    public function send(Request $request){
       
        $contact = new contact;
        $contact->c_name= $request['c_name'];
        $contact->c_email= $request['c_email'];
        $contact->c_mobile = $request['c_mobile'];
        $contact->c_password=$request['c_password'];
        $contact->save();
        return "Record inserted successfully";
    }
