//MODEL

The model is used to perform data-related operations like insert, update, read, and delete data.

Step 1:

Create a model using the command line

    php artisan make:model ModelName
  OR
    php artisan make:model MOdelName --migration

Step 2:
Connect the table and primary key in the model

    protected $table ='employee';
    protected $primaryKey='e_id';

Step 3:
give the namespace of model in Route file


    use App\Models\ModelName;

step 4:
Load the model inside of route or controller
and store its data in array


    Route::get('emp',function(){
    $data = employee::all();
    print_r($data->toArray());
    });

Here 'employee' is the table name
all() is an ORM allocate function of the model.
